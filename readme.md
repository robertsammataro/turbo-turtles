# Turbo Turtles

This is our team repo for our Turbo Turtles game created in W23 HAWAII for CISC367. This is an educational game intended to teach young students basic computer science concepts, custom-tailored for a Hawaiian audience.


## HW11 Team Contributions:

**Robby Sammataro:** Created the basic quiz engine and UI elements that will be used for the main game scene.


**Abbey Walters:** Added beach background and sprite to main game scene. Sprite will move towards the ocean with every correct question answered. *currently working on creating lesson plans*

**Himanshu Patel** Created the Title Screen which consists of a background image, turtle images, Game Title, and a Play Now button which switches scenes to the Quiz Scene. Created the Level One: Data Types Quiz Questions for the game. 

**Kyle Regan** Created the Level Select Screen which allows the user to select which computer science lesson they want to play. Currently, the options are data types, indices, and sorting. Once the level is selected, the respective lesson will be activated. I also coded the scoring system, the game is not finished yet so I have not pushed the code for scoring but once the game has an "end" I will display the amount of stars awarded.
